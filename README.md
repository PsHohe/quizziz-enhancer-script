# quizziz-enhancer-script

**Quizizz** is a great tool for teachers and **Paper Mode**, in particular is  fantastic to easily implement gamification in the classroom.

However, I've found that the default interface for the teacher, the one you're supposed to display to the students using a projector, has some special drawbacks that hinder its usability.
 
This script makes some enhancements to that interface.

- It increases the default Font Size to 1.8rem. This makes it easier to read the questions and choices.
- It redistributes the ratio for the question and the answer buttons, so each zone uses 50% of the height, instead of 45% and 55%.
- It redistributes the width ratio for the image and the question when there's an image in the question, so now the image uses 50% of the space, instead of 40%. This makes it easier to see the details on the image.
- It makes the images clickable and, when clicked, they expand to appear over the page in full size.
